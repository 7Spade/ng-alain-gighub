# Supabase Configuration
# DO NOT commit real credentials to the repository
# These are placeholder values for development setup guidance

# Supabase Project URL

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Supabase Anonymous Key (Public Key)
# Get from: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Note: For production deployment, configure these environment variables in:
# - Vercel: Project Settings → Environment Variables
# - Netlify: Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment
# - Docker: docker-compose.yml or .env file (excluded from git)
# - Kubernetes: ConfigMap or Secrets

# Development Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (which is git-ignored)
# 2. Replace placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials
# 3. The Angular app reads these via environment.ts configuration
# 4. For runtime configuration, use window.__env__ pattern (see docs)

# Yarn Dependency Management Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Security Standards](./security.mdc), [Build and Deployment](./build-deploy.mdc)

## Yarn Usage Standards

- Use Yarn as package manager
- Always commit `yarn.lock`
- Use `yarn install` not `npm install`
- Use `yarn add` to add dependencies
- Use `yarn upgrade` to update dependencies

## Version Management

- Use semantic versioning
- Lock major versions for critical dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Test after dependency updates

## Security Checks

- Run `yarn audit` regularly
- Fix security vulnerabilities immediately
- Use `yarn audit fix` when available
- Monitor dependency security advisories

## Reference Documentation

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

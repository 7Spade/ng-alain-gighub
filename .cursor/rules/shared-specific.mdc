# Shared Module Specific Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Shared Module Priority](./shared-imports.mdc), [Architecture Standards](./architecture.mdc), [Code Quality](./code-quality.mdc)

## SHARED_IMPORTS Priority Usage

- All shared components must be exported through SHARED_IMPORTS
- See [SHARED_IMPORTS Usage Guide](../../docs/45-SHARED_IMPORTS-使用指南.md)
- Ensure all reusable components are included in SHARED_IMPORTS

## Reusable Component Design

- Components must be generic and reusable
- Use OnPush change detection
- Use Signals for state management
- Standalone components only

## Utility Functions and Shared Services

- Place utility functions in `shared/utils/`
- Place shared services in `shared/services/`
- Ensure proper exports in index files

## Dependency Rules

- ONLY import from `shared/` - no imports from `routes/`, `layout/`, or `core/`
- This prevents circular dependencies
- Shared module must be self-contained

## Reference Documentation

- [SHARED_IMPORTS Usage Guide](../../docs/45-SHARED_IMPORTS-使用指南.md) ⭐ Must Read
- [Architecture Standards](./architecture.mdc)

# Performance Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Angular Best Practices](./angular.mdc), [Build and Deployment](./build-deploy.mdc)

## Bundle Size Monitoring

- Monitor bundle size regularly using `yarn analyze`
- Keep main bundle under reasonable size
- Use lazy loading for feature modules
- Use code splitting for large dependencies

## Performance Metrics

- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s

## Optimization Strategies

- Use OnPush change detection (see [Angular Best Practices](./angular.mdc))
- Use trackBy functions for lists
- Lazy load images and routes
- Minimize bundle size
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists

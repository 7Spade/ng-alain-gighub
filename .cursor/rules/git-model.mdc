# Git-like Branching Model Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Architecture Standards](./architecture.mdc), [Git Workflow](./git-workflow.mdc), [Security Standards](./security.mdc)

## Prohibition of Violating Branch Model

- Prohibit collaborating organizations from modifying task structure (only assignment fields can be filled)
- Prohibit bypassing PR mechanism to directly update main branch data
- Prohibit modifying data in branches that does not belong to assignment fields

## Version Control Standards

- Use Semantic Versioning
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format (see [Git Workflow](./git-workflow.mdc))
- Major changes need to update CHANGELOG.md
- Branch naming follows standards (feature/, fix/, refactor/)
- Run lint and type-check before commit (see [Linting](./linting.mdc), [Type Safety](./typescript.mdc))

## Branch Permissions

- Branch permissions must be verified at both database layer (RLS) and application layer (see [Security Standards](./security.mdc))
- PR merge operations must verify owner permissions
- Staging area rollback operations must verify submitter identity

# Build and Deployment Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Performance](./performance.mdc), [Security Standards](./security.mdc), [Dependency Management](./dependency-management.mdc)

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
yarn build

# Production build
yarn build --configuration production

# Analyze bundle size
yarn analyze
yarn analyze:view
```

## Performance Analysis

- Regularly analyze bundle size
- Monitor build time
- Optimize import statements
- Use lazy loading for routes

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- Run all tests: `yarn test-coverage`
- Run linting: `yarn lint`
- Run type checking: `yarn type-check`
- Build successfully: `yarn build`
- Security audit: `yarn audit`

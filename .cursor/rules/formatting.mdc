# Prettier Code Formatting Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Linting](./linting.mdc), [Git Workflow](./git-workflow.mdc)

## Basic Principles

- All code must be formatted using Prettier
- Must ensure code is formatted before commit
- Use unified formatting configuration to ensure team consistency
- Prettier configuration takes precedence over editor settings

## Execution Methods

```bash
# Check formatting (usually through ESLint integration)
yarn lint

# Manual formatting (if Prettier CLI is configured)
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,html,json}"
```

## Configuration Requirements

- Use `eslint-config-prettier` to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier (see [Linting](./linting.mdc))
- Use `eslint-plugin-prettier` to run Prettier as an ESLint rule
- Ensure `.prettierrc.js` or `.prettierrc` configuration file exists

## Formatting Rules

- Use 2-space indentation (typically)
- Use single quotes (typically)
- Trailing commas (ES5+)
- Line width limit (typically 80 or 100 characters)
- Semicolon usage (according to project configuration)

## Editor Integration

- Configure editor to auto-format on save
- Use Prettier extension plugins
- Ensure editor uses Prettier configuration from project root

## Git Hooks Integration

- Auto-format before commit through `lint-staged` (see [Git Workflow](./git-workflow.mdc))
- Ensure committed code is formatted

## Important Notes

- Prettier only handles formatting, not code quality
- Use with ESLint, ESLint handles code quality checks (see [Linting](./linting.mdc))
- Don't manually adjust code formatted by Prettier

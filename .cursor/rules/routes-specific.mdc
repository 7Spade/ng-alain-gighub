# Routes Module Specific Standards

> **Related Rules**: See [Architecture Standards](./architecture.mdc), [API Design](./api-design.mdc), [Git-like Branching Model](./git-model.mdc)

## Route Configuration

- Each feature module should have its own routing
- Use lazy loading for feature routes
- Follow consistent route naming

## API Design Standards

- Use Repository pattern for data access
- All database operations via Supabase client
- Implement proper error handling

## Business Logic Organization

- Keep business logic in services
- Components should be thin, delegating to services
- Use Signals for reactive state

## Git-like Branching Model Integration

- Understand branching model when working in routes/blueprint/
- Implement branch permissions correctly
- Handle PR workflows properly

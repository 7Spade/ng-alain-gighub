# Demo Routes

This folder contains demo and example routes from the ng-alain framework. These are kept for reference and testing purposes but are not part of the core business application.

## Contents

- **data-v/** - Data visualization examples
- **delon/** - @delon component library demos (acl, cache, form, st, util, xlsx, zip, etc.)
- **extras/** - Extra example pages (help center, POI, settings)
- **pro/** - Pro template examples (account, form, list, profile, result pages)
- **style/** - Style guide and typography examples
- **widgets/** - Widget showcase and examples

## Purpose

These routes are maintained to:
- Provide reference implementations for ng-alain and NG-ZORRO components
- Serve as examples for common UI patterns
- Help developers understand framework capabilities
- Support testing and development workflows

## Usage

All routes in this folder are accessible via their original paths (e.g., `/style`, `/delon`, `/pro`, etc.) but the code is now organized under `demo/` for better project structure clarity.
